    "## Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback on its actions and experiences.\n",
    "RL uses rewards and punishment as signals for \"good\" and \"bad\" behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, at each step, the agent outputs an action, which is input to the environment. The environment evolves according to its dynamics, the agent observes the new state of the environment\n",
    "and (optionally) a reward, and the process continues until hopefully the agent learns what behavior maximizes its reward.\n",

    "## Markov decision process (MDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A MDP is a discrete-time stochastic control process. The MDP model is based on the idea of an environment that evolves as a Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov chain\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is a model of the dynamics of a discrete time system that obeys the (first order) \"Markov property,\" meaning that the state $s^{t+1}$ at time\n",
    "$t+1$ is conditionally independent of the state at times $0, \\ldots, t-1$ given the state at time $t$, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(s^{t+1} \\mid s^t, s^{t-1}, \\ldots, s^0) = p(s^{t+1} \\mid s^t). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, we might say that the current state is all you need to know to predict the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, a Markov chain is defined by a set of possible states $S={s_0, s_1, \\ldots, s_n}$ and a transition matrix $T(s,s')$\n",
    "containing the propbabilities of state $s$ transitioning to state $s'$. Here is a visualization of a simple Markov chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/RL_markov.png\" title=\"Markov chain\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be interested in [this Markov chain simulator](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the dynamics of the environment in a MDP are slightly different from that of a simple Markov chain. We have to consider how the agent's\n",
    "actions affect the system's dynamics. At each time step, rather than just\n",
    "transitioning randomly to the next state, we add the agent's action as an external input or disturbance $a \\in A$, so (assuming a small number of discrete\n",
    "states and actions) the transition probabilities become a 3D tensor of size $|S|\\times |A|\\times |S|$\n",
    "mapping each state/action pair to a probability distribution over the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple MDP\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have three states and two actions and that the state/action transition tensor is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/RL_statetrans.png\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 200px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete our simple MDP, we need a *reward function* $R$ and a *discount factor* $\\gamma$. \n",
    "Suppose $R = [ 1, 0, -1 ]$ and $\\gamma = 0.5$. Let's define our MDP in Python with PyTorch tensors:\n"
