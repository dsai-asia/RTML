    "GNN provides a convenient method for performing node-, edge-, and graph-level prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "GNNs have recently received a lot of attention because of their\n",
    "ability to analyze graph structured data such as a set of objects and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to incorporate graph-structured information, in a data processing step,\n",
    "the underlying graph structure is encoded using the topological relationships between the nodes of the graph.\n",
    "Graph models include recursive neural networks and Markov chains, which are commonly used to solve graph and node-focused problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a data structure made up of two parts: a set of *vertices* ($V$) and a set of *edges* ($E$).\n",
    "A graph is a mathematical structure that is used to examine the pair-wise relationship between objects and entities.\n",
    "Edges can be either *directed* or *undirected*, depending on whether there exist directional dependencies between the vertices.\n",
    "Here's an example graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GNNSimpleGraph.webp\" title=\"A simple Graph\" style=\"width: 150px;\" />\n",

    "Mathematically, the graph's adjacency matrix has a value of 1 at element $(i,j)$ only when there is an edge\n",
    "from node $i$ to node $j$;\n",
    "otherwise the value should be zero. Here's an example for the a directed graph in which the edges have directionality:\n",

    "\n",
    "A GNN is a type of neural network that operates directly on\n",

    "In a node classification problem, each node has a label, and we want to predict\n",
    "the label of each node without using the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we'll give the idea of the simplest form of GNN using message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GNN message passing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node $i$ in a node classification problem is\n",
    "identified by feature vector $x_i$ and associated with a ground truth label\n",
    "$y_i$. The goal is to use the labeled nodes in a partially labeled graph $G$ to predict the labels of the unlabeled nodes.\n",
    "We may have multiple layers of processing in which we transform\n",
    "$x_i$ to a hidden representation $h_i$ containing\n",
    "information about node $i$'s neighbors. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_i=f(x_i,x_{co[i]},h_{ne[i]},x_{ne[i]}),$$\n",

    "of node $i$'s neighboring nodes, and $x_{ne[i]}$ refers to the features of node\n",
    "$i$'s neighboring nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if $f()$ is simple enough,\n",
    "we can use the Banach fixed point theorem to rewrite the above equation as an iteratively updated process that\n",
    "gives a unique solution for the $h_i$. This iterative operation is also known as *message passing* or *neighborhood aggregation*.\n",
    "Concatenating the $x_i$ and $h_i$ we can write $f$ as\n",

    "### Output\n",

    "\n",
    "DeepWalk was\n",
    "the first algorithm to perform unsupervised node embedding learning.\n",
    "It is trained similarly to a word embedding model.\n",

    "1. Perform random walks on nodes in the graph to generate node sequences\n",
    "2. Run a skip-gram algorithm to learn an embedding of each node based on the node sequences generated in step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step of the random walk, the next node is sampled uniformly from the neighbors of the previous node. Each sequence is then truncated into\n",
    "sub-sequences of length $2|w| + 1$, where $w$ denotes the window size in the skip-gram method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram method is explained well in [this article from Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/word-embedding-with-word2vec-and-fasttext-a209c1d3e12c).\n",

    "the probabilities of each sub-path from the root node to the leaf $v_k$. Because the probability of each node's children sums to one,\n",
    "the property that the sum of the probability of all vertices equals one remains valid in the hierarchical softmax.\n",

There are three aggregation functions as:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function is defined as the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $u$ and $v$ co-occur in a fixed-length random walk, while $v_n$ are the negative samples that don’t co-occur with $u$. Such loss function encourages nodes closer to have similar embedding, while those far apart to be separated in the projected space. Via this approach, the nodes will gain more and more information about their neighborhoods.\n",

    "- Link prediction\n",
    "- Graph classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of node classification is to predict the node embedding for each node in a graph. This type of problem is typically trained semi-supervised, with only a portion of the graph labeled. Citation networks, Reddit posts, YouTube videos, and Facebook friendships are examples of common node classification applications.\n",

    "## GNN Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "GNN is frequently used in natural language processing (NLP), which is where GNN got its start. If you've worked with natural language processing (NLP), you're probably thinking that text is a type of sequential or temporal data that we can describe with a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a long short-term memory (LTSM). GNN, on the other hand, approaches the problem from an entirely different perspective. GNN predicts categories by utilizing the inner relationships of words or documents. A citation network, for example, attempts to predict each paper's label in a network based on the paper citation relationship and the words cited in other papers. GNN can also construct a syntactic model by examining different parts of sentences rather than only working sequentially as RNN or LTSM do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Many GNN-based methods have achieved cutting-edge performance in image object detection, but we still don't know the relationships between the objects. Using graphs to model relationships between objects detected by a CNN-based detector is one successful application of GNN in computer vision (CV). After detecting objects in images, they are fed into a GNN inference for relationship prediction. The GNN inference produces a generated graph that models the relationships between various objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/16_gnn.png\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 500px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Image generation from graph descriptions is another intriguing CV application. This is almost the inverse of the preceding application. Text-to-image generation using generative adversarial network (GAN) or autoencoder is the traditional method of image generation. Rather than using text to describe images, graph-to-image generation provides more information about the semantic structures of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/17_gnn.png\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 500px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intriguing application is zero-shot learning (ZSL), which learns to classify an object with no target class training samples. If no training samples are provided, the model must think in order to recognize a target. Assume we're given three images and told to find an okapi among them. We've never seen an okapi before, but if we're also told that an okapi is a deer-faced animal with four legs and zebra-striped skin, it's not difficult to figure out which one is an okapi. The detected features are typically converted into text to simulate this thought process. Text encodings, on the other hand, are independent of one another. The relationships between the text descriptions are difficult to model. Graph representations, on the other hand, accurately model these relationships and assist the machine in thinking more like a human.\n",

    "\n",
    "Human behavior detection, traffic control, molecular structure study, recommender systems, program verification, logical reasoning, social influence prediction, and adversarial attack prevention are some of the more practical applications of GNN. Through social network analysis, for example, GNN can be used to cluster people into different community groups."
