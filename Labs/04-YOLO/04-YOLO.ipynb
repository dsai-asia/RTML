    "## Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "If you could go back in time to the 1990s, there were no cameras that could find faces in a photograph, and no\n",
    "researcher had a way to count dogs in a video in real time. Everyone had to count the dogs manually.\n",
    "Times were very tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holy Grail of computer vision research at the time was real time face detection. If we could find faces\n",
    "in images fast enough, we could build systems that interact more naturally with human beings. But nobody had\n",
    "a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things changed when Viola and Jones introduced the first real time face detector, the Haar-like cascade, at\n",
    "the end of the 1990s.\n",
    "This technique swept a detection window over the input image at multiple sizes, and subjected each local patch\n",
    "to a cascade of simple rough classifiers. Each patch that made it to the end of the cascade of classifiers was\n",
    "treated as a positive detection. After a set of candidate patches were identified, there would be a cleanup\n",
    "stage when neighboring detections are clustered into isolated detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method and one cousin, the HOG detector, which was slower but a little more accurate, dominated during the 2000s\n",
    "and on into the 2010s. These methods worked well enough when trained carefully on the specific environment they were\n",
    "used in, but usually couldn't be transfer to a new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of AlexNet and the amazing advances in image classification, we could follow the direction\n",
    "of R-CNN, to use a region proposal algorithm followed by a deep learning classifier to do object detection VERY slowly\n",
    "but much more accurately than the old real time methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is YOLO?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it wasn't until YOLO that we had a deep learning model for object detection that could run in real time.\n",
    "It took some clever insight to realize that everything, from feature extraction to bounding box estimation, could\n",
    "actually be done with a single neural network that could be trained end-to-end to detect objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO (You Only Look Once) uses only convolutional layers. This makes it a \"fully convolutional network\" or FCN.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLOv3 has 75 convolutional layers, with skip connections and upsampling layers. No pooling is used, but there is a convolutional\n",
    "layer with stride 2 used for downsampling. Strided convoution rather than pooling was used to prevent loss of fine-grained detailed\n",
    "information about the precise location of low-level features that would otherwise occur with pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the output of a convolutional layer is a feature map. Applying convolutional layers to a possible detection window or\n",
    "region of interest (ROI) in the image then classifying the ROI's feature map is a reasonable method for detection prediction that\n",
    "is used in Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN.\n",
    "However, the innovation of YOLO was to use the feature map directly to predict bounding boxes and, for each bounding box, to\n",
    "predict whether or not an object is at the center of the bounding box. Finally, a classifier is used for each bounding box\n",
    "to indicate the content of the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO v3 from \"scratch\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Early versions of YOLO were very fast but not nearly as accurate as their slower cousins. YOLO v3 included many of the\n",
    "tricks and techniques used by other models, such as multiscale analysis, and it achieved both high accuracy and fast inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll experiment with building up the YOLO v3 model in PyTorch. However, we won't train it ourselves, as that would\n",
    "require days of training; instead, we'll\n",
    "grab the weights for our PyTorch YOLO v3 from the original Darknet model by Joseph Redmon and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ground Truth Bounding Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we present example images and corresponding object bounding boxes to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input image is divided into grid cells. The number of cells depends on the number of convolutional layers\n",
    "and the stride of each of those convolutional layers. For example, if we use a 416$\\times$416 input image size,\n",
    "and we apply 5 conv layers with a stride of 2 each (for a total downsampling factor of 32), we end up with a 13$\\times$13\n",
    "feature map, each corresponding to a region in the original image of size 32$\\times$32 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ground truth box has a center (x and y position), a width, and a height. Normally the ground truth boxes would be\n",
    "provided by a human annotator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ground truth box's center must lie in some grid cell in the original image. Consider this example from the YOLO paper:"

    "The grid is represented by the black lines. The ground truth bounding box for the object is the yellow rectangle. The center\n",
    "of this bounding box happens to be within the red-outlined grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid cell containing the center of a ground truth bounding box is given the responsibility during training to try to predict\n",
    "the presence of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to indicate the presence of the given object, the model outputs several parameters for a given candidate object:\n",
    " - $(t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)$ indicate the box's location and size. During training, the targets for these outputs are the actual ground truth box parameters.\n",
    " - $p_o$ is an \"objectness\" score that indicates the likelihood that an object exists in the given bounding box. This output uses a sigmoid function.\n",
    "   During training, the target for $p_o$ is set to 1 for the center grid cell (the red grid cell), and it is set to 0 for the the neighboring grid cells.\n",
    " - $(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n)$ are class confidence scores. They indicate the probability of the detected object belonging to a particular class. The targets,\n",
    "   obviously, are set to 1 for the ground truth object class and 0 for other classes during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that would occur in YOLO if you tried to directly learn the parameters mentioned above is the problem of unstable gradients during training.\n",
    "In a way that is sort of analagous to how a residual block begins with an identity map and learns differences from identity, YOLO v3 uses the idea of\n",
    "anchor boxes originally introduced by the R-CNN team. Instead of predicting $(t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)$ directly, we predict how those parameters are *different from\n",
    "the parameters of a typical bounding box, an anchor box*.\n",
    "YOLO v3 uses three bounding boxes per cell. At training time, once ground truth bounding box's center is mapped to a grid cell, we find which of the anchors for\n",
    "that cell has the highest IoU with the ground truth box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What Does YOLO Actually Predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's understand that all predictions are relative to the grid cell. YOLO predicts the following:\n",
    "- Offsets $(t_x, t_y)$ are specified relative to the top left corner of the grid cell, as a ratio between 0 and 1, using a sigmoid to limit the values.\n",
    "- Height, and width $(t_w, t_h)$ are specified relative to the dimensions of an anchor box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, YOLO does not predict absolute coordinates -- it predicts values that can then be used to compute the box's position and size in absolute coordinates.\n",
    "This diagram gives the idea. We see that the absolute $t_x$ is the grid cell's $(c_x, c_y)$ plus $\\sigma(t_x)$ times the grid cell width. Similarly for $t_y$.\n",
    "The absolute width of the predicted bounding box is the width of the anchor box times $e^{tw}$. Similarly for the height."

    "\n",
    "1. Follow the YOLO v3 and YOLO v4 implementations in PyTorch and get inference working for both models\n",
    "   using the pretrained Darknet weights. This will give you a good understanding of YOLO in general\n",
    "   and many of the specific improvements made in YOLO v4. For YOLO v4, pay attention to the main points:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Implementation of the mish activation function\n",
    "   2. Option for the maxpool layer in the `create_modules` function and in your model's `forward()` method.\n",
    "   3. Enabling a `[route]` module to concatenate more than two previous layers\n",
    "   4. Loading the pre-trained weights [provided by the authors](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights)\n",
    "   4. Scale inputs to 608$\\times$608 and make sure you're passing input channels in RGB order, not OpenCV's BGR order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train your implementation of YOLO v4. The COCO dataset is available on the AIT DS&AI GPU servers at `/home/fidji/mdailey/Datasets/COCO`.\n",
    "   Here the purpose is not to get the best possible model (that would require implementing all\n",
    "   of the \"bag of freebies\" training tricks described in the paper), but just the ones described here, to\n",
    "   get a feel for their importance.\n",
    "   This involves the following:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. Get a set of ImageNet pretrained weights for CSPDarknet53 [from the Darknet GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/csdarknet53-omega_final.weights)\n",
    "   2. Add a method to load the pretrained weights into the backbone portion of your PyTorch YOLOv4 model.\n",
    "   3. Implement a basic `train_yolo` function similar to the `train_model` function you developed in previous\n",
    "      labs for classifiers that preprocesses the input with basic augmentation transformations, converts the\n",
    "      anchor-relative outputs to bounding box coordinates, computes MSE loss for the bounding box coordinates,\n",
    "      backpropagates the loss, and takes a step for the optimizer. Use the recommended IoU thresholds to determine\n",
    "      which predicted bounding boxes to include in the loss. You will find many examples of how to do this\n",
    "      online.\n",
    "   4. Train your model on COCO. Training on the full dataset to completion would take several days, so you can stop early after verifying\n",
    "      the model is learning in the first few epochs.\n",
    "   5. Compute mAP for your model on the COCO validation set.\n",
    "   6. Implement the CIoU loss function and observe its effect on mAP.\n",
    "   7. (Optional) Train on COCO to completion and see how close you can get to the mAP reported in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "   There is some useful information on working with the COCO dataset as a\n",
    "   Torchvision Dataset in [this blog](https://medium.com/howtoai/pytorch-torchvision-coco-dataset-b7f5e8cad82).\n",
    "   Use the instructor's copy of the COCO training and validation datasets from the shared network drive\n",
    "   so that we don't use resources for multiple copies of the dataset. Once you have access to the dataset you can use the dataset easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The state of the art in fast single-stage object detection in 2022 appears to be YOLOR.\n",
    "   Take a look at the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04206) and the [PyTorch source code](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolor).\n",
    "   Execute the same exercise as above to modify your PyTorch Darknet tools to read the YOLOR configuration file and get the model working\n",
    "   first for inference then for training. We will execute this task collaboratively and share experience on the class discussion board as\n",
    "   we go along.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note that YOLOR is built on top of [Scaled YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036), in which several different versions of the\n",
    "   CSP Darknet backbone are created for different speed/accuracy tradeoffs. We probably want to start with YOLOR P6, which is based on\n",
    "   YOLOv4-P6, which obtains 54.3% COCO mAP at 30 fps with resolution 1280$\\times$1280.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We want you to modify the YOLOv4 code you already developed to work with the YOLOR model. Don't just replace your code with the YOLOR\n",
    "   repository code. Instead, try to trace the execution of the image preparation, `create_modules()` function, `forward()` method, and\n",
    "   so on.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You'll need to make at least the following modifications to make your code run the same as YOLOR:\n",
    "   1. Allow flexible input image size for the letterboxing, with input size 1280 in the longest dimension and a multiple of 64 pixels in the\n",
    "      other dimension.\n",
    "   2. Since the YOLOR weight files are PyTorch pickle files, you'll need to name the convolutional and implicit latent parameter layers\n",
    "      the same as in the YOLOR weight file so that you can load the state dictionary as with other PyTorch models.\n",
    "   3. Utilize the YOLOR non maxima suppression function, as it is much faster than the one we gave you in this manual for the YOLOR output\n",
    "      tensors.\n",
    "   4. Utilize the YOLOR conversion of model output tensors to bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class scores. The organization\n",
    "      and post processing is different from our YOLOv4 configuration, so your `predict_transform()` function won't work as is.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   Good luck!\n"
