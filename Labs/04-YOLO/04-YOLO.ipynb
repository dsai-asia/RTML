    "task: object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "If you could go back in time to the 1990s, there were no cameras that could find faces in a photograph, and no\n",
    "researcher had a way to count dogs in a video in real time. Everyone had to count the dogs manually.\n",
    "Times were very tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holy Grail of computer vision research at the time was real time face detection. If we could find faces\n",
    "in images fast enough, we could build systems that interact more naturally with human beings. But nobody had\n",
    "a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things changed when Viola and Jones introduced the first real time face detector, the Haar-like cascade, at\n",
    "the end of the 1990s.\n",
    "This technique swept a detection window over the input image at multiple sizes, and subjected each local patch\n",
    "to a cascade of simple rough classifiers. Each patch that made it to the end of the cascade of classifiers was\n",
    "treated as a positive detection. After a set of candidate patches were identified, there would be a cleanup\n",
    "stage when neighboring detections are clustered into isolated detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method and one cousin, the HOG detector, which was slower but a little more accurate, dominated during the 2000s\n",
    "and on into the 2010s. These methods worked well enough when trained carefully on the specific environment they were\n",
    "used in, but usually couldn't be transfer to a new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of AlexNet and the amazing advances in image classification, we could follow the direction\n",
    "of R-CNN, to use a region proposal algorithm followed by a deep learning classifier to do object detection VERY slowly\n",
    "but much more accurately than the old real time methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is YOLO?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it wasn't until YOLO that we had a deep learning model for object detection that could run in real time.\n",
    "It took some clever insight to realize that everything, from feature extraction to bounding box estimation, could\n",
    "actually be done in a single model that could be trained end-to-end to detect objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO (You Only Look Once) uses only convolutional layers. This makes it a \"fully convolutional network\" or FCN.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLOv3 has 75 convolutional layers, with skip connections and upsampling layers. No pooling is used, but there is a convolutional\n",
    "layer with stride 2 used for downsampling to prevent loss of low-level features when use pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the output of a convolutional layer is a feature map, which is then used for detection prediction.\n",
    "However, the innovation of YOLO was to uses the feature map directly to predict bounding boxes and, for each bounding box, to\n",
    "predict whether or not an object is at the center of the bounding box. Finally, a classifier is used for each bounding box\n",
    "to indicate the content of the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO v3 from \"scratch\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll experiment with building up the YOLO v3 model in PyTorch. However, we won't train it ourselves; we'll\n",
    "grab the weights from the original Darknet model by Joseph Redmon and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/YOLO_v3_tutorial_from_scratch.\n",

    "### Ground Truth Bounding Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we present example images and corresponding object bounding boxes to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input image is divided into grid cells. The number of cells depends on the number of convolutional layers\n",
    "and the stride of each of those convolutional layers. For example, if we use a 416$\\times$416 input image size,\n",
    "and we apply 5 conv layers with a stride of 2 each (for a total downsampling factor of 32), we end up with a 13$\\times$13\n",
    "feature map, each corresponding to a region in the original image of size 32$\\times$32 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ground truth box has a center (x and y position), a width, and a height. Normally the ground truth boxes would be\n",
    "provided by a human annotator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ground truth box's center must lie in some grid cell in the original image. Consider this example from the YOLO paper:"

    "The grid is represented by the black lines. The ground truth bounding box for the object is the yellow rectangle. The center\n",
    "of this bounding box happens to be within the red-outlined grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid cell containing the center of a ground truth bounding box is given the responsibility during training to try to predict\n",
    "the presence of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to indicate the presence of the given object, the model outputs several parameters for a given candidate object:\n",
    " - $(t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)$ indicate the box's location and size. During training, the targets for these outputs are the actual ground truth box parameters.\n",
    " - $p_o$ is an \"objectness\" score that indicates the likelihood that an object exists in the given bounding box. This output uses a sigmoid function.\n",
    "   During training, the target for $p_o$ is set to 1 for the center grid cell (the red grid cell), and it is set to 0 for the the neighboring grid cells.\n",
    " - $(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n)$ are class confidence scores. They indicate the probability of the detected object belonging to a particular class. The targets\n",
    "   obviously, are set to 1 for the ground truth object class and 0 for other classes during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that would occur in YOLO if you tried to directly learn the parameters mentioned above is the problem of unstable gradients during training.\n",
    "In a way that is sort of analagous to how a residual block begins with an identity map and learns differences from identity, YOLO uses the idea of\n",
    "anchor boxes introduced by the R-CNN team. Instead of predicting $(t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)$ directly, we predict how those parameters are *different from\n",
    "the parameters of a typical bounding box, an anchor box*.\n",
    "YOLO uses three bounding boxes per cell. At training time, once ground truth bounding box's center is mapped to a grid cell, we find which of the anchors for that cell has the highest\n",
    "IoU with the ground truth box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What Does YOLO Actually Predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's understand that all predictions are relative to the grid cell. YOLO predicts the following:\n",
    "- Offsets $(t_x, t_y)$ are specified relative to the top left corner of the grid cell, as a ratio between 0 and 1, using a sigmoid to limit the values.\n",
    "- Height, and width $(t_w, t_h)$ are specified relative to the dimensions of an anchor box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, YOLO does not predict absolute coordinates -- it predicts values that can then be used to compute the box's position and size in absolute coordinates.\n",
    "This diagram gives the idea. We see that the absolute $t_x$ is the grid cell's $(c_x, c_y)$ plus $\\sigma(t_x)$ times the grid cell width. Similarly for $t_y$.\n",
    "The absolute width of the predicted bounding box is the width of the anchor box times $e^{tw}$. Similarly for the height."
