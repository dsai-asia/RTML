    "## Some important terms for PyTorch and deep learning with CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensor**: a multidimensional matrix for calculation. Inputs, outputs, and weights are all stored as tensors. A CNN will have an \"input\" tensor as input (one or more images), and an \"output\" tensor as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel**: a filter tensor or weight tensor, most often used in a convolution computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel**: when we deal with 2D feature maps, the third-from-last dimension indexes the channel or depth dimension. A 2D image stored as a tensor has three dimensions: channel, row, and column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature**: could refer to the result of a convolution operation (feature \"map\") or a hand-crafted input to a model or a unit in a linear/dense/fully-connected layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature extraction**: the process of transforming raw data into numerical features that concentrate and/or preserve the useful information in the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stride**: The jump necessary to go from one element to the next when performing an operation on an input tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding**: Additional elements added around the boundaries of a tensor to allow convolution operations or other operations to preserve size. Padding is usually with 0 elements, but other methods include copy-border and mirror reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, we do not have to specify the input size to a convolution operation, but we do need to specify the number of input channels and the kernel size and stride. Any specific operation will lead to a specific ouptut size depending on the input size. For dense or fully-connected layers, however, we need to specify the number of input features as well as the number of output features, so it is necessary to understand how to calculate how tensor operations affect the output tensor size."

    "\n",
    "$$k = k_w k_h i_c,$$\n",

    "## AlexNet using the Module API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequential API makes it easy to create a sequential model, but not all models are sequential. For example, we need more flexibility\n",
    "to create a complex model such as GoogLeNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with the `Module` API requires us to use object-oriented inheritance in Python. This means you'll have to brush up on your OO concepts or learn the basics if OOP is new to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a new class that inherits from `Module`, then in most cases, we just need to override two methods: `__init__()` and `forward()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__()` is called the \"constructor\" of a class and is the method called on any Python object just after it is created, similar to constructors in Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, constructors and instance methods work a little differently in Python than they do in Java or C++. The constructor is just an ordinary instance method that is only special in that it\n",
    "is called implicitly when the object is created. Instance methods in Python (methods called on an object) are distinguished from class methods (methods called on the class, not requiring any\n",
    "instance) by the presence or absence of the `self` keyword in the parameter list. In the body of an instance method, `self` is a reference to the instance the method was called on, same as\n",
    "`this` in Java or C++ or `self` in Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anther difference between Python and other languages is that object initialization in an inheritance hierarchy is more flexible.\n",
    "A constructor should normally call `super(ClassName, self).__init__()` (Python 2, also works in Python 3) or `super().__init__()` (Python 3 only) at the beginning of its\n",
    "own `__init__()` method to initialze any fields used by methods in the superclass, but it need not do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a PyTorch `Module` subclass, we should call `super()` before doing other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward()` method is also an instance method that is implicitly called when we invoke a `Module` instance as a function. So the code\n",
    "\n",
    "    module = MyModule()\n",
    "    \n",
    "creates an instance of `MyModule` and then calls its `__init__()` method, whereas\n",
    "\n",
    "    outputs = module(inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "invokes the `forward()` method defined in `MyModule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an implementation of an AlexNet-like network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `Sequential` is itself a subclass of `Module`. This means we can use `Sequential` for a sequential flow in a larger network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the adaptive average pool layer between the feature module and the classifier is a trick used to ensure a fixed set of 6x6 feature maps come out\n",
    "of the feature extractor regardless of the input image size. It is not strictly required here (and not used in the original paper) but would allow us to use other input sizes besides 224x224 if we like.\n"

    "\n",
    "Next, we'd like to construct GoogLeNet as described in the [original GoogLeNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the lab is adapted from [kuangliu's PyTorch CIFAR repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/master/models/googlenet.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### GoogleLeNet\n",
    "\n",
    "GoogleLeNet or Inception network is an important concept for development CNN classifier. Most of CNNs just stacked convolution deeper and deeper to get performance, but very deep networks are prone to overfitting. It also hard to pass gradient updates through the entire network, and make computation expensive. In the other hands, inception network do in wider path to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/expandDeeper.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several versions of the inception networks such as Inception v1, Inception v2, Inception v3, Inception v4, and Inception-ResNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full architecture of GoogLeNet (inception1) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GoogleLeNet.png\" style=\"width: 1080px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inception block\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation introduced by GoogLeNet is the concept of the \"inception\" block. A standard inception block looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/inception.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the middle part of the network from “dying out”, the authors introduced two auxiliary classifiers (The purple boxes in the image). They essentially applied softmax to the outputs of two of the inception modules, and computed an auxiliary loss over the same labels. The total loss function is a weighted sum of the auxiliary loss and the real loss. Weight value used in the paper was 0.3 for each auxiliary loss.\n",

    "1. Create VSCode projects for each of these three networks. Be sure to properly define your Python classes, with one class per file and a main module that sets up your\n",
    "   objects, runs the training process, and saves the necessary data.\n",
    "2. Note that the AlexNet implementation here does not have the local response normalization feature described in the paper. Take a look at the\n",
    "   [PyTorch implementation of LRN](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LocalResponseNorm.html) and incorporate it into your AlexNet implementation as\n",
    "   it is described in the paper. Compare your test set results with and without LRN.\n",
    "3. Note that the backbone of the GoogLeNet implemented thus far does not correspond exactly to the description. Modify the architecture to\n",
    "   1. Use the same backbone (input image size, convolutions, etc.) before the first Inception module\n",
    "   2. Add the two side classifiers\n",
    "4. Compare your GoogLeNet and AlexNet implementations on CIFAR-10. Comment on the number of parameters, speed of training, and accuracy of the two models on this dataset when\n",
    "   trained from scratch.\n",
    "5. Experiment with the pretrained GoogLeNet from the torchvision repository. Does it give better results on CIFAR-10 similar to what we found with AlexNet last week? Comment\n",
    "   on what we can glean from the results about the capacity and generalization ability of these two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the same format as last week. Describe your experiments and their results. The report should be turned in on Google Classroom before next week's lab.\n"
